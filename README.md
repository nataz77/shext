# shext
Collection of shell script because sometimes I'm too lazy to write the whole command


## Get started!
Easy!
Clone this repo and source the files to the shell of your preference.

For example, I'm using OhMyZsh and to add the files it's just a few lines at the end of the `.zshrc` file

```bash
source ~/ext/opensslext.sh
source ~/ext/tarext.sh
source ~/ext/sourceenv.sh #this may be redundant if you're using the .env oh-my-zsh plugin but still sometimes I use it
```

## Contribuiting
Feel free to open a pull request adding new scripts! I'm going to be adding mines as I make new ones
